# contrail-container-deployer

This set of playbooks installs Contrail Networking using a microservices architecture.

# quick start for the impatient (requires a CentOS7 instance)...

This set of commands will configure the instance and install AIO contrail with k8s on the instance:
```
ssh-copy-id 192.168.1.100
yum install -y ansible
git clone http://github.com/Juniper/contrail-ansible-deployer
cd contrail-ansible-deployer
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ -e orchestrator -e '{"instances":{"bms1":{"ip":"192.168.1.100","provider":"bms"}}}' playbooks/configure_instances.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ -e orchestrator=none -e '{"instances":{"bms1":{"ip":"192.168.1.100","provider":"bms"}}}' playbooks/install_contrail.yml
```
The ip address 192.168.1.100 has to be replaced with the instances ip address

# the long story

## container grouping

All processes are running in their own container.
The containers are grouped together into services, similiar to PODs
in kubernetes.

## instructions

### get the playbooks

```
git clone http://github.com/Juniper/contrail-ansible-deployer
```

### Providers

The playbooks support installing Contrail on these providers:
-- bms - Baremetal Server
-- kvm - KVM hosted Virtual Machines
-- gce - GCE hosted Virtual Machines
-- aws - AWS hosted Virtual Machines

### The plays

The playbook contains three plays:

- playbooks/provision_instances.yml

Provisions operating system instances for hosting the containers
to the following infrastructure providers:

-- kvm
-- gce
-- aws
-- azure (to be implemented)
-- openstack (to be implemented)

- playbooks/configure_instances.yml

Configures provisioned instances. Applicable to all providers.
Installs software, configures operating system as outlined under
prerquisites.

- playbooks/install_contrail.yml

Pulls, configures and starts Contrail containers.

#### configuration

Configuration for all three plays is done in a single file (default locataion:
config/instances.yaml)
The configuration has multiple main sections.

#### provider configuration

This section configures provider specific settings.

```
### Contrail services configuration
This section sets global contrail service parameters. All parameters are optional.

```
contrail_configuration:     # Contrail service configuration section
  CONTAINER_REGISTRY: opencontrailnightly
  CONTRAIL_VERSION: latest
  UPGRADE_KERNEL: true
```

### Kolla services configuration
In case kolla openstack is deployed, this section defines the paramters for it.

```
kolla_configuration:

```

### Instances
Instances are the operating systems on which the containers will be launched.
The instance configuration has only a very few provider specific knobs.
The instance configuration specifies which roles are installed on which instance.
Furthermore instance wide and role specifc contrail and kolla configurations can be
specified, overwriting the paramters from the global contrail and kolla configuration
settings.

#### GCE default AIO instance
This is a very simple all in one GCE instance. It will install all contrail roles
and kubernetes master and node using default configuration.
```
instances:
  gce1:                          # Mandatory. Instance name
    provider: gce                # Mandatory. Instance runs on GCE
```
#### AWS default AIO HA
This example uses three EC2 instances to deploy and AIO HA setup with all roles
and default parameters.
```
instances:
  aws1:
    provider: aws
  aws2:
    provider: aws
  aws3:
    provider: aws
```

#### KVM control plane instance
A KVM based instance only installing contrail control plane containers.
```
instances:
  kvm1:
    provider: kvm
    roles:
      config_database:
      config:
      control:
      analytics_database:
      analytics:
      webui:
      k8s_master:
```

### start the playbooks

Instance provisioning:
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/provision_instances.yml
```

Instance configuration:
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/configure_instances.yml
```

Contrail installation:
orchestrator can be openstack (installs kolla) or none (for pure k8s installations).
```
ansible-playbook -e orchestrator=none|openstack -i inventory/ playbooks/install_contrail.yml
```

The location of the configuration file (config/instances.yaml) can be changes
using the -e config_file= parameter, i.e.:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ -e config_file=/config/instances_gce.yml playbooks/install_contrail.yml
```

yaml and json formats are supported.
